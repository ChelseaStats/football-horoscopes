You should find Brighton will mostly be drawn offside</p><h2>Leo</h2><p>last quarter Jupiter puts you on high alert, consider an appeal to the FA</p><h2>Virgo</h2><p>You are not alone, there are support charities if you are a fan of Watford and they are getting you down</p><h2>Libra</h2><p>Moon-Saturn alignment gives you motivation to worry about Man City wanting to appoint manager's dog as director of football</p><h2>Scorpio</h2><p>descending Sun puts Aston Villa in crisis, there are clear-the-air talks, it's a complete meltdown</p><h2>Sagittarius</h2><p>Today you will find yourself under the cosh as Spurs dominates your box</p><h2>Capricorn</h2><p>Mars-Neptune alignment focuses you to harness the energy of Brighton's star player</p><h2>Aquarius</h2><p>Windfall! there is a strong indication Everton's star player will fall over at the slightest gust of wind</p><h2>Pisces</h2><p>first quarter Mars in Pisces is a gentle reminder keep your Thursdays and Sundays free</p>
