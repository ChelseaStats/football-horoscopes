<h2>Aries</h2><p>With the last quarter Jupiter in your sleep sector, insomniacs should try watching Liverpool</p><h2>Taurus</h2><p>A counter-attacking focus on this first quarter Uranus in Taurus means you should think about Palace's decision to consider employing Tim Sherwood</p><h2>Gemini</h2><p>last quarter Saturn and your 10th house. You may worry about West Brom wanting to appoint manager's dog as director of football</p><h2>Cancer</h2><p>An attacking focus on this rising Moon in Cancer means you could worry about Liverpool's unused player refusing to sit on the bench</p><h2>Leo</h2><p>Neptune-Neptune alignment focuses you to think about Man City's great show of character</p><h2>Virgo</h2><p>Jamie Redknapp and Virgo in your 8th house, try to avoid conflict intellectually. Silence</p><h2>Libra</h2><p>Misaligned Sun makes rising star put in a transfer request at the 11th hour. Rat.</p><h2>Scorpio</h2><p>Misaligned Mars makes rising star put in a transfer request at the 11th hour. Rat.</p><h2>Sagittarius</h2><p>With today's Neptune allocated to Sagittarius do question if that is all West Ham take away</p><h2>Capricorn</h2><p>With today's Jupiter in Capricorn be careful what you say about Southampton, their fans get upset easily</p><h2>Aquarius</h2><p>Saturn in your 7th house and Mercury in the 10th house brings you to find Man City will mostly be drawn offside</p><h2>Pisces</h2><p>your outer Pluto and Pisces in your 4th house means any mention of gegenpressing will make you poop a little</p>
