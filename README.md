You may think about Newcastle's injured, heavy smoking midfielder</p><h2>Leo</h2><p>With the last quarter Pluto in your sleep sector, insomniacs should try watching West Ham</p><h2>Virgo</h2><p>Today you will find yourself under the cosh as Liverpool dominates your box</p><h2>Libra</h2><p>Don't bother going to see Wolves's next game the bloke next to you will smell like he's shat himself, twice.</p><h2>Scorpio</h2><p>Today's Neptune-Sun match-up may remind you to worry about Newcastle's lack of high intensity runs</p><h2>Sagittarius</h2><p>Saturn in Sagittarius and your 3rd house urges for real pace but worry about Southampton's high intensity runs</p><h2>Capricorn</h2><p>Uranus-Moon opposition will probably means you think about Palace's decision to consider employing Tim Sherwood</p><h2>Aquarius</h2><p>Jupiter in Aquarius and your 12th house gives motivation to think about Liverpool's penalty takers</p><h2>Pisces</h2><p>With today's Uranus allocated to Pisces do question if that is all Southampton take away</p>
