<h2>Aries</h2><p>Today's Neptune-Neptune opposition could force you to harness the energy of Arsenal's star player</p><h2>Taurus</h2><p>Today's Mercury-Jupiter conjunction points you to consider Everton's ineffective crossing</p><h2>Gemini</h2><p>Jamie Redknapp and Gemini in your 1st house, try to avoid conflict intellectually. Silence</p><h2>Cancer</h2><p>A counter-attacking focus on this waning Pluto in Cancer means you should worry about Newcastle's lack of high intensity runs</p><h2>Leo</h2><p>With today's Sun allocated to Leo do question if that is all Wolves take away</p><h2>Virgo</h2><p>Don't bother going to see Man City's next game the bloke next to you will smell like he's shat himself, twice.</p><h2>Libra</h2><p>Moon-Mars opposition will probably means you bet on the opposite of Lawro's Fulham prediction</p><h2>Scorpio</h2><p>A counter-attacking focus on this last quarter Venus in Scorpio means you should consider Palace's character</p><h2>Sagittarius</h2><p>The Saturn-Uranus opposition could give rise to a bad moment. You must worry about Watford's high intensity runs</p><h2>Capricorn</h2><p>gibbous Pluto and your 8th house. You may watch out for Man City's defensive errors</p><h2>Aquarius</h2><p>last quarter Neptune in Aquarius. You should consider Brighton inverting their fullbacks</p><h2>Pisces</h2><p>Saturn-Mars alignment. You may harness the energy of Fulham's star player</p>
