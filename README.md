<h2>Aries</h2><p>An attacking focus on this first quarter Mercury in Aries means you could think about Southampton's injured, heavy smoking midfielder</p><h2>Taurus</h2><p>first quarter Neptune in Taurus. Life exists outside the virtual waiting room.</p><h2>Gemini</h2><p>Today's Uranus-Mercury opposition could force you to worry about Southampton wanting to appoint manager's dog as director of football</p><h2>Cancer</h2><p>With today's Jupiter allocated to Cancer do question if that is all Wolves take away</p><h2>Leo</h2><p>Mars in Leo and your 8th house gives motivation to worry about Palace trying to utilise the double pivot</p><h2>Virgo</h2><p>Retrograde Mars in Virgo reminds you your team is ageing, you are ageing. everyone is ageing</p><h2>Libra</h2><p>Today's Sun in Libra aligns so you may worry about Leeds's unused player refusing to sit on the bench</p><h2>Scorpio</h2><p>Today's Uranus-Mercury match-up may remind you to find Liverpool will perform for you</p><h2>Sagittarius</h2><p>With the waning Neptune in your giant hands talking nonsense sector, try to avoid Niall Quinn</p><h2>Capricorn</h2><p>gibbous Sun as your team heads north, danger comes in the form of a Stanley-knife-wielding trackie-wearing probationer</p><h2>Aquarius</h2><p>Neptune in your 6th house and Mars in the 9th house brings you to draw strength from Spurs's defensive positioning</p><h2>Pisces</h2><p>last quarter Pluto in 1st house means you must worry about Leeds's high profile player unfollowing the club on twitter</p>
