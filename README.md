<h2>Aries</h2><p>gibbous Sun puts you on high alert, consider an appeal to the FA</p><h2>Taurus</h2><p>Today's Pluto-Neptune match-up may remind you to worry about Southampton trying to utilise the double pivot</p><h2>Gemini</h2><p>With the ascending Uranus in your giant hands talking nonsense sector, try to avoid Niall Quinn</p><h2>Cancer</h2><p>Misaligned Jupiter makes rising star put in a transfer request at the 11th hour. Rat.</p><h2>Leo</h2><p>Venus in Leo prompts you to ignore Niall Quinn's unsure and ever changing opinion on West Ham's performance. TV replays notwithstanding</p><h2>Virgo</h2><p>Today you will find yourself waving your imaginary card at Spurs</p><h2>Libra</h2><p>Don't bother going to see Newcastle's next game the bloke next to you will smell like he's shat himself, twice.</p><h2>Scorpio</h2><p>eclipsing Venus and your 12th house. You may consider West Ham's character</p><h2>Sagittarius</h2><p>changing Moon and your 9th house. You may worry about Leicester wanting to appoint manager's dog as director of football</p><h2>Capricorn</h2><p>waning Neptune in 4th house means you must worry about West Brom's squad player liking their own transfer rumour on instagram</p><h2>Aquarius</h2><p>A defensive minded Saturn in Aquarius means it's time to worry about Brighton's unused player refusing to sit on the bench</p><h2>Pisces</h2><p>Uranus in Pisces and your 853rd house gives motivation to worry about Watford trying to utilise the double pivot</p>
