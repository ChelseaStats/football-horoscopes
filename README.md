<h2>Aries</h2><p>Misplaced passing between Mars and Venus could breed thoughts that forces you to think about Fulham's injured, heavy smoking midfielder</p><h2>Taurus</h2><p>gibbons Pluto in Taurus and your 1st house. You may think about Chelsea's poor disciplinary record</p><h2>Gemini</h2><p>With the waning Jupiter in your giant hands talking nonsense sector, try to avoid Niall Quinn</p><h2>Cancer</h2><p>your developing Pluto in your 7th house has Martin Keown in your neighbourhood, it's ok to phone the police/zoo</p><h2>Leo</h2><p>descending Mars in 6th house means you must think about Watford's injured, heavy smoking midfielder</p><h2>Virgo</h2><p>gibbons Pluto puts you in a position of conflict, family or football. Only you can decide</p><h2>Libra</h2><p>Misaligned Mars appoints Mike Dean in your referee sector. Its all about him.</p><h2>Scorpio</h2><p>Today's Neptune in Scorpio aligns so you may think about Liverpool's penalty takers</p><h2>Sagittarius</h2><p>A defensive minded Mercury in Sagittarius means it's time to worry about Newcastle wanting to appoint manager's dog as director of football</p><h2>Capricorn</h2><p>With the first quarter Saturn in your sleep sector, insomniacs should try watching Watford</p><h2>Aquarius</h2><p>your outer Jupiter and Aquarius in your 3rd house means any mention of gegenpressing will make you poop a little</p><h2>Pisces</h2><p>gibbons Mercury in Pisces. Life exists outside the virtual waiting room.</p>
