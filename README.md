You may worry about possession based hipsters from North London</p><h2>Taurus</h2><p>It's a difficult day if you support Brighton, try not to burn your own town</p><h2>Gemini</h2><p>waxing Uranus in your descendant 5th house. You should worry about Newcastle conceding too many shots</p><h2>Cancer</h2><p>The Mars-Pluto opposition could give rise to a bad moment. You must worry about Watford's lack of big chances</p><h2>Leo</h2><p>With the waning Jupiter sparks a lucky streak, Peter Reid is at the bar and he'll get a round in</p><h2>Virgo</h2><p>Today's Moon-Uranus match-up may remind you to worry about Newcastle's unused player refusing to sit on the bench</p><h2>Libra</h2><p>With the waxing Sun sparks a cup run. consider booking European tour</p><h2>Scorpio</h2><p>Today's Venus in Scorpio aligns so you may worry about Arsenal's high profile player unfollowing the club on twitter</p><h2>Sagittarius</h2><p>your retrograding Mars in your 4th house has Martin Keown in your neighbourhood, it's ok to phone the police/zoo</p><h2>Capricorn</h2><p>Uranus in Capricorn prompts you to ignore Niall Quinn's unsure and ever changing opinion on West Brom's performance.
