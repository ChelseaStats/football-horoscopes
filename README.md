<h2>Aries</h2><p>Retrograde Mars in Aries reminds you that your star player is racist but it's ok as he scores goals</p><h2>Taurus</h2><p>waning Pluto as your team heads north, danger comes in the form of a Stanley-knife-wielding trackie-wearing probationer</p><h2>Gemini</h2><p>descending Jupiter in Gemini. You should worry about possession based hipsters from North London</p><h2>Cancer</h2><p>With today's Sun in Cancer a brief encounter with a youth player from Liverpool is on the cards</p><h2>Leo</h2><p>your asserting Saturn in your 7th house has Martin Keown in your neighbourhood, it's ok to phone the police/zoo</p><h2>Virgo</h2><p>Alignment between Neptune and Venus could bring about the need to think about West Brom's great show of character</p><h2>Libra</h2><p>last quarter Sun in Libra. Life exists outside the virtual waiting room.</p><h2>Scorpio</h2><p>Today's waning Mars in Scorpio is the clearest indication that red trousers are not for you</p><h2>Sagittarius</h2><p>last quarter Jupiter in 6th house means you must worry about Aston Villa qualifying for the Europa League</p><h2>Capricorn</h2><p>With the last quarter Moon sparks a cup run. consider booking European tour</p><h2>Aquarius</h2><p>Retrograde Moon in Aquarius reminds you your team is ageing, you are ageing. everyone is ageing</p><h2>Pisces</h2><p>With the ascending Neptune in your giant hands talking nonsense sector, try to avoid Niall Quinn</p>
