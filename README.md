Life exists outside the virtual waiting room.</p><h2>Libra</h2><p>With the gibbons Mercury in your faith sector, a chance encounter with Glenn Hoddle reminds you how to behave in this life</p><h2>Scorpio</h2><p>The gibbons Mercury in your 4th house of full backs means you should worry about Fulham's high number of instagram selfies</p><h2>Sagittarius</h2><p>Retrograde Saturn in Sagittarius reminds you that your star player is racist but it's ok as he scores goals</p><h2>Capricorn</h2><p>Today's Mars in Capricorn aligns so you may find Chelsea will perform for you</p><h2>Aquarius</h2><p>Saturn in your 5th house and Moon in the 9th house brings you to worry about Liverpool trying to utilise the double pivot</p><h2>Pisces</h2><p>Looks like Mercury in Pisces means Burnley are on the up.</p>
